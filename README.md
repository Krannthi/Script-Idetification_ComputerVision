# Script-Idetification_ComputerVision

The Project is used to differntiate three scripts 'Hindi', 'Kannada' and 'English' using local Script Identification approach.
The Program takes pages as inputs, divides it into lines and thes calculates features for each line. Based on these features the
script is identified.
Firstly the program is trained with these scripts. The trained data is then used for testing.
KNN Classifier is used for testing the data.
Results are mentioned in the 'REPORT' file.
Code is written in Python and OpenCV libraries are used.
